The final output is shown from the above image with the accuracy of 0.580991268157959.

**Summary**

The summary of this project is we did analysis on this data and analyze different things using different machine learning models. The summary of the results is explained in the below screen shots. Different machine learning models can solve this problem. If we use unsupervised machine learning model we may get better performance.so, my recomendation is Unsepervised machine learning model.
